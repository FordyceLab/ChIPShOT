    So I jump ship in Hong Kong and I make my way over to Tibet, and I get on
    as a looper at a course over in the Himalayas. A looper, you know, a caddy,
    a looper, a jock. So, I tell them I'm a pro jock, and who do you think they
    give me? The Dalai Lama, himself. Twelfth son of the Lama. The flowing
    robes, the grace, bald... striking. So, I'm on the first tee with him. I
    give him the driver. He hauls off and whacks one - big hitter, the Lama -
    long, into a ten-thousand foot crevasse, right at the base of this glacier.
    Do you know what the Lama says? Gunga galunga... gunga, gunga-lagunga. So
    we finish the eighteenth and he's gonna stiff me. And I say, "Hey, Lama,
    hey, how about a little something, you know, for the effort, you know." And
    he says, "Oh, uh, there won't be any money, but when you die, on your
    deathbed, you will receive total consciousness." So I got that goin' for
    me, which is nice.
